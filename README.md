*Update Aug-2021: new_main.py has been removed from repository, as that file was not used in the final project. It directly queried parallaxes and parallax errors from Gaia â€“ now deprecated as querying the Bailer-Jones dataset is much more optimal.*

*Update Sep-2021: Paper complete - consider reading it at [this Google Drive link.](https://drive.google.com/file/d/11TxkhQw7F2r95BMYVrF5d2FJ8mYIXSZt/view?usp=sharing)*

*Update Mar-2022: Uploaded paper to project folder for easier reference: [see here](Science_Extension_Report.pdf).*
